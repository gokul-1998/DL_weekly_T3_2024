1. Which of the following components of a biological neuron is primarily responsible for processing information received from other neurons in the brain?
- Dendrites
- Soma
- Axon
- Synapses

###### Solution: 
The **soma** (also called the cell body) is primarily responsible for processing information received from other neurons in the brain. It integrates the signals received from the dendrites and determines whether to send a signal down the axon.

Here's a quick overview of the components:
- **Dendrites**: Receive signals from other neurons.
- **Soma**: Processes and integrates the incoming signals.
- **Axon**: Transmits the processed signal away from the neuron.
- **Synapses**: Junctions where signals are transmitted between neurons.
