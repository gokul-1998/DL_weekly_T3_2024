- today's ai is dominated by connectionism, which is a type of machine learning that is inspired by the brain.
    - the brain is a network of neurons that are connected to each other.

- there were two different types  of ai,
    - connectionism
    - symbolic ai
        - meaning based on symbols
        - the brain is not a network of neurons, but a network of symbols

- now ppl want to come up with Hybrid AI
    - combining connectionism and symbolic ai
    - they are realising that both are needed , because both have their own strengths and weaknesses
