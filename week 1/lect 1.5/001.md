- fair , responsible and green AI
    - fair AI: AI systems that are designed to minimize bias and ensure that they are inclusive and equitable
        - eg; facial recognition systems that are trained on diverse datasets to avoid bias against certain groups of people like black people as thief or criminal
    - responsible AI: AI systems that are designed to be transparent and accountable
        - eg; AI systems that are used in healthcare should be able to explain their decisions and provide evidence for their recommendations
    - green AI: AI systems that are designed to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly
        - eg; AI systems that are trained on renewable energy sources like solar power or wind power
